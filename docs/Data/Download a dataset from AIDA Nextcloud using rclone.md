### Step 1 - Setup a remote

`rclone config create drsk webdav url=https://nextcloud.aida.scilifelab.se/public.php/webdav vendor=nextcloud user=<USERNAME> pass=<PASSWORD>`

Here, we have chosen the name `drsk` for the remote. You can of course choose whatever name you want. Probably use something short that doesn't contain spaces.

Your username is the last part of the share link you got from us, i.e: `https://nextcloud.aida.scilifelab.se/s/USERNAME`

Your username could for example be something like `Y4gVyiVyyiF6fug`.

Your password is the string of random characters you got from us separately. You will probably need to "quote" or 'quote' it on the command line, as it very likely contains special characters.

If you'd rather answer questions interactively, do this instead, and do what it says: `rclone config`

The exact questions may differ depending on what version rclone you have.

### Step 2 - Download from the remote
Use the same name here that you chose in the previous step.

`rclone copy drsk: .`

Or if you want progress written to the terminal:

`rclone copy --progress drsk: .`
